Participants
The students sampled in this data came from a large sample of Foundations students in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 academic year, who had written messages for the Genie in the email system. The dates sampled were from August 1, 2016 to June 17, 2017 and August 1, 2017 to June 17, 2018. There were a total of 34,602 such students in 2016-17 and 12,287 students in 2017-18. The students were from 462 different schools located in 99 different districts, most of which were located in Texas.  

Language Data
Our language sample for this analysis consisted of messages sent from the students to the Genie, a virtual pedagogical agent. Because many messages contained few words, we aggregated all emails sent by each student to create a representation of an individual studentâ€™s linguistic activity. The corpus has a total of 1,605,982 tokens across the two years. In addition, we have a corpus of messages sent by the students to their teachers in the system with a total of 312,254 tokens. For each of the messages sent by the students, we also have the response they received from the Genie (an employee) or the teacher. On average, students sent 8.73 (SD=10.2) messages in 2016-17 and 8.73 (SD=11.04) messages in 2017-18 to the Genie and 6.84 (SD=6.14) messages in 2016-17 and 7.02 (SD=6.27) messages in 2017-18 to the teacher. The average length of aggregated messages to Genie is 816.2 (SD=1546.4) characters in 2016-17 and 1529.98 (SD=4649.9) characters in 2017-18. The average length of aggregated messages to teachers is 671.3 (SD=2107.6) characters in 2016-17 and 976.3 (SD=2398.3) characters in 2017-18. After proposing the project, we were also able to get 2 extra years of data (2013-14, 2014-15). With the full data from the four years, we now have a total of 34751 students which were split into train-dev-test in 75-15-15 ratio.
