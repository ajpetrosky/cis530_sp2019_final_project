The main goal of this paper was to effectively train a topic model in a very short text corpus (i.e. Twitter). The
models used in this paper were LDA (which we are using for our published baseline) and author-topic model (an extension
of the LDA model). More of focus, is that the paper claims aggragating of messages can lead to better performance with
standard topic models, as opposed to using the individual tweets.
